This folder should contain your images used by the site.
Please add the following files (case-sensitive):
- avatar.jpg    -> Your profile photo (replace existing placeholder)
- project1.jpg  -> Example project image

You can add more images as needed. After adding images, commit and push to GitHub so Netlify can display them.
